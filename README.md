# ASM
Welcome to my GitHub repository for assembly language programming projects! Here, I'll will be posting various projects that I've worked on using Emu8086, a popular assembler and emulator for x86-based computer architecture.


Each project contains a detailed explanation of what it does, how it works, and the code itself. Additionally, I've included any necessary files and resources to help you run the code on your own computer.

Whether you're just starting out with assembly programming or looking to expand your knowledge and skills, I hope you find these projects helpful and informative. Feel free to explore the repository, try out the code, and contribute to the projects if you'd like.

Thank you for visiting, and happy coding!

## Installation
### Windows
[Download EMU8086 here](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com)

### Linux
Unfortunately,  emu8086 doesn't work on Linux, but there are alternatives.

[NASM (Netwide Assembler)](https://www.nasm.us): NASM is a popular open-source assembly compiler that runs on multiple platforms including Linux. It supports several output formats and has many features that make it a powerful assembler.</br>
[GAS (GNU Assembler)](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&q=GNU+Assembler+download&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8): GAS is the default assembler for the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and is commonly used on Linux. It supports a wide range of architectures and is highly customizable.</br>
[FASM (Flat Assembler)](https://flatassembler.net): FASM is another popular open-source assembler that runs on multiple platforms including Linux. It is known for its small size, speed, and flexibility.</br>
[Yasm](https://yasm.tortall.net): Yasm is an open-source assembler that supports many output formats and is designed to be highly modular and extensible.<br>

You try [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org) or [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/in/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html) to run EMU8086 on your system.
