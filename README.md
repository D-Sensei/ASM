# ASM
Welcome to my GitHub repository for assembly language programming projects! Here, I'll will be posting various projects that I've worked on using Emu8086, a popular assembler and emulator for x86-based computer architecture.

Each project contains a detailed explanation of what it does, how it works, and the code itself. Additionally, I've included any necessary files and resources to help you run the code on your own computer.

Whether you're just starting out with assembly programming or looking to expand your knowledge and skills, I hope you find these projects helpful and informative. Feel free to explore the repository, try out the code, and contribute to the projects if you'd like.

Thank you for visiting, and happy coding!
